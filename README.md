Q: How many possible pairs of elements are there in an array of size n?  
A) log n  
B) n  
C) n^2  
D) 2^n  
A: **C) n^2**  
There are exactly n \* (n - 1) / 2 distinct pairs of integers in the array. This is equivalent to (n^2 - n) / 2, and we normally consider the largest term, which in this case is n^2.
