### Part I - Arrays and Hashing

#### Chapter 1 - Contains Duplicate (Blind)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
-   `10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

___

How many possible pairs of elements are there in an array of size n?

A) log n

B) n

C) n^2

D) 2^n

###### ID1

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: C

There are exactly n \* (n - 1) / 2 distinct pairs of integers in the array. This is equivalent to (n^2 - n) / 2, and we normally consider the largest term, which in this case is n^2.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
-   `10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

___

What is the time complexity of a brute force approach, where you compare every possible pair in the array to check if there are any duplicates?

D) O(2^n)

###### ID2

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: C

The brute-force solution using two nested loops has a time complexity of O(n^2) because for each element in the array, you need to iterate over up to n other elements.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
-   `10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

___

What data structure can you use to optimize the approach for checking if there are any duplicate elements in the array?

A) Queue

B) Priority Queue

C) Stack

D) Hashmap or HashSet

###### ID3

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: D

A Hashmap (or Hashtable) and a HashSet allow us to store and retrieve values in constant time, O(1). We can utilize this property to efficiently check for duplicates.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
-   `10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

___

How can a HashSet be used to efficiently check for duplicates in the array?

A) Iterate through each element in the array and try to insert it into the HashSet. If an insertion fails (the element already exists in the HashSet), return true to indicate a duplicate was found.

B) Insert all elements from the array into the HashSet without checking for duplicates during this process. After all insertions, compare the size of the HashSet with the size of the array. If the HashSet size is smaller, return true to indicate a duplicate exists.

C) Both A and B

###### ID4

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: C

A HashSet does not allow duplicate values. So, if you try to insert an element that already exists in the HashSet, it will not add the element and you know you've found a duplicate (choice A). Alternatively, you could add all elements to the HashSet and then compare its size to the size of the array. If the sizes are different, then there must have been a duplicate in the array (choice B). Both these methods will help identify if a duplicate exists in the array.

Space complexity: O(1)

D) Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)

###### ID5

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: A

The hashmap solution has a time complexity of O(n) because you need to iterate through the array once. Also, the key lookup operation with hashmaps runs in O(1) time. The space complexity is also O(n) because, in the worst case, you might need to store all n elements in the hashmap.

#### Chapter 2 - Valid Anagram (Blind)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise_.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

C) Both words have the same first letter.

D) Both words have the same last letter.

###### ID6

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. This means both words have the same letters, in the same quantities. For example, 'Heart' is an anagram of 'Earth'.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise_.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

___

Given the nature of anagrams, which of the following methods can be used to check if two words are anagrams?

A) Compare the lengths of two words. If they are equal, the words are anagrams.

B) Convert each word to an array, sort the arrays, and then compare them.

C) Check if the first letter of the first word is present in the second word.

###### ID7

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

By converting each word to an array, sorting the arrays, and then comparing them, we can confirm if two words are anagrams. This is because anagrams have the same letters in the same quantities. For example, after sorting either 'heart' and 'earth', the result is 'aehrt'.

Given the nature of anagrams and the constraints of the problem, can you improve upon the overall time complexity of the sorting solution?

A) No, sorting and comparing is the most optimal solution.

B) Yes, by using a hashmap to store the count of letters.

C) Yes, by checking if the first and last letter of both words are the same.

###### ID9

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

Given the constraints of the problem and the nature of anagrams, we can use a hashmap to store the count of letters for each string. This would allow us to compare the frequency of each letter in both strings in a more time-efficient way. The downside is we may need extra memory, compared to an in-place sorting algorithm.

C) Time complexity: O(n^2), Space complexity: O(1)

D) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)

###### ID11

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: A

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we iterate over the input strings once. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst-case scenario (where each letter is unique), we would need to store each letter in the hashmap.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Roughly how many pairs of integers are there within the array? Assume the size of the array is `n`.

A) log n

B) n

C) n^2

D) 2^n

###### ID12

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: C

There are exactly n \* (n - 1) / 2 distinct pairs of integers in the array. This is equivalent to (n^2 - n) / 2 and we normally care about the largest term, which in this case is n^2.

C) Using divide and conquer to recursively find pairs

###### ID13

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

To find all pairs of elements with different indices in the array, you can use two nested loops. The first loop iterates over each element, while the second loop only iterates over the elements to the right of the current element. This allows you to compare all possible pairs without duplicates.

Q:: =============================================

D) n

###### ID15

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: A

We can solve this equation for y: y = target - x. For example, if target=9, and x=2, then y = 9 - 2 = 7. In mathematics, this value is known as the complement.

D) Yes, using a balanced binary search tree

###### ID16

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: C

Yes, you can reduce the time complexity using a hashmap. A hashmap allows you to store and retrieve values in O(1) - constant time, which can help you find the required indices more efficiently than a brute-force solution.

How can a hashmap be used to efficiently find the indices of two numbers that add up to the target in an array?

A) Key = Index of each element, Value = Difference between the target and the corresponding element;  
then for each element check if the difference between the target and the element exists as a value in the hashmap.

B) Key = Each element in the array, Value = The index of the corresponding element;  
then for each element check if the difference exists in the hashmap as a key, and that it has a different index from the current element.

###### ID17

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

By storing each element in the array as a key and its index as the corresponding value in the hashmap, you can efficiently find the required pair. For each element, you can efficiently calculate the difference and check if it’s a key within the hashmap. If it does, we can get the index from the hashmap. If the index of the difference is different from the index of the current element (remember we are not allowed reuse the same element twice), then you've found the solution.

#### Chapter 8 - Encode and Decode Strings (Blind)


Q:: =============================================  

##### Design an algorithm to encode **a list of strings** to **a string**. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement `encode` and `decode`

**Example1**

```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
-   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
-   `strs[i] contains any possible characters out of 256 valid ASCII characters`

___

Given the constraint that `strs[i]` can contain any valid ASCII characters, including special ones, which encoding strategy should we use to ensure that our encoded message can be correctly decoded?

A) Separate strings in strs using a special character, such as a comma or a space.

B) Use a length-prefix followed by a special character for each string in strs.

C) Concatenate all the strings in strs directly.

###### ID19

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

If we use a special character to separate the strings, it could be a problem if the string itself contains this special character. If we concatenate the strings directly, we can't distinguish where one string ends and another begins. Therefore, prefixing each string with its length followed by a special character allows us to correctly separate the strings during decoding, even if they contain special characters.

C) Prefix each string with the sum of the lengths of all previous strings.

###### ID20

A:: =============================================

B) Time complexity: O(n^2), Space complexity: O(n)

C) Time complexity: O(n log n), Space complexity: O(n)

###### ID22

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: A

The overall time complexity of the solution is determined by the number of characters in the strings list (strs). We iterate over all characters twice: once when encoding and once when decoding. Therefore, the time complexity is linear. The space complexity is also linear because the encoded string has the same number of characters as the original strings list plus the length of each string and a colon for each string.

Suppose we are counting the length of a sequence starting at an arbitrary value, say `n = 1.` To extend this sequence, we need to efficiently check for the existence of the next integer `(n + 1)`, regardless of its index in the original array. Which data structure would best serve this purpose?

A) Priority Queue

B) HashSet

C) Binary Search Tree

D) Array

###### ID24

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

A HashSet can be used to efficiently check the existence of elements in O(1) average time complexity. When extending a sequence, this property is essential, allowing us to determine if the next integer (n + 1) exists in the original array, regardless of its position.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the _length of the longest consecutive elements sequence_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
-   `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

___

Consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. If we naively iterate through this array, treating each element `n` as the potential start of a sequence, we would check for the existence of each subsequent number `n + 1`. What would be the time complexity of such an approach?

A) O(n)

B) O(n log n)

C) O(n^2)

D) O(2^n)

###### ID25

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: C

For every element in the array, except for 6, the follow-up element n + 1 does exist. So for each element, in the worst case, we would iterate n - 1 times to build each sequence, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2).

___

Consider the array `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`. This array contains two sequences: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `[100, 200]`. What common trait do the starting elements `1` and `100` share, which suggests they are the beginning of these sequences?

A) They are the smallest numbers in their respective sequences.

B) The element (n - 1) does not exist in the array.

C) The element (n + 1) does exist in the array.

D) They are the largest numbers in their respective sequences.

###### ID26

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

The key observation is that for any number 'n' to be the start of a sequence, the number (n - 1) must not exist in the array. This is because if (n-1) exists, 'n' would be part of a sequence starting at least from (n-1). In this case, for '1' and '100', neither '0' nor '99' exist in the array, indicating that '1' and '100' can indeed be the starting points of their sequences.

___

Knowing that an element 'n' is the start of a sequence if (n - 1) does not exist in the array, how could we efficiently solve this problem using a hashset?

A) Add all elements to the hashset. Then, for each element 'n', if (n - 1) is not in the hashset, check and count the longest sequence starting from 'n'.

B) Add all elements to the hashset. Then, for each element 'n', if (n + 1) is in the hashset, check and count the longest sequence starting from 'n'.

###### ID27

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: A

We then iterate through each element 'n' and if (n - 1) is not in the hashset, we check for the longest sequence starting from 'n'. This is because if (n-1) does not exist, 'n' must be the starting point of a sequence. We then check for the existence of (n + 1), (n + 2), and so on in the hashset, and count the length of the sequence. This approach ensures that we don't repeatedly check the same sequence and keeps the time complexity to O(n).

What is the time and space complexity of the optimal solution using a HashSet and avoiding unnecessary checks?

A) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)

B) Time complexity: O(n log n), Space complexity: O(n)

C) Time complexity: O(n^2), Space complexity: O(1)

D) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)

###### ID28

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: A

The HashSet solution has a time complexity of O(n) because you need to iterate through the array twice (once for building the HashSet and once for checking the sequences). The space complexity is also O(n) because, in the worst case, you might need to store all n elements in the HashSet.

B) Time complexity: O(n log n), Space complexity: O(n)

C) Time complexity: O(n^2), Space complexity: O(1)

D) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)

###### ID32

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: A

The time complexity is O(n) because all operations (lowercase conversion, removing non-alphanumeric characters, and reversing the string) take linear time. The 'n' here is the length of the string. The space complexity is also O(n) because we are creating a new string for the reversed version, which can be as long as the input string.

Is there a way to check if a string is a palindrome without creating a new string for the reversed version?

A) No, it's not possible.

B) Yes, by using two pointers.

C) Yes, by sorting the string.

D) Yes, by using a stack.

###### ID33

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

Yes, it is possible. You can use two pointers: one starting from the beginning of the string and the other from the end. If the characters at both pointers are equal, we increment the left pointer and decrement the right pointer. If they are not equal, then the string is not a palindrome. This approach avoids creating a new string for the reversed version, thus saving space.

What are the time and space complexities of the two-pointer approach to check if a string is a palindrome?

B) Time complexity: O(n log n), Space complexity: O(n)

C) Time complexity: O(n^2), Space complexity: O(1)

D) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)

###### ID34

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: D

The time complexity is O(n) because in the worst case, we would have to compare every character in the string with its counterpart from the end. Here, 'n' is the length of the string. This is still linear time complexity. The space complexity is O(1) because no extra space proportional to the size of the input is used. The two pointers used do not scale with the input size.

C) Sort the array and apply binary search for each element, O(n^2 log n) time complexity

###### ID35

A:: =============================================

How can we find the optimal solution by using sorting?

A) Sort the array and use two pointers, decreasing the time complexity to O(n^2)

B) Sort the array and use binary search, decreasing the time complexity to O(n^2 log n)

C) Sorting cannot help in optimizing this problem

###### ID36

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: A

By sorting the array, we can iterate through the array once and then use a two-pointer approach for each iteration. The two pointers can move towards each other until they meet, checking if the sum of the elements at the pointers equals the negative of the current element. This reduces the time complexity to O(n^2). A binary search approach will also work, but is less efficient.

How does the two-pointer approach help in eliminating duplicates in the output?

A) It doesn't, duplicates must be handled separately

B) By skipping over duplicate elements in the sorted array after finding a valid triplet, and also when choosing the first number in the triplet

C) By checking if the current triplet is already in the output before adding it

###### ID38

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

When we find a valid triplet, we increment the left pointer until we find a new value. This ensures that we do not add the same triplet multiple times when the array contains duplicates. Additionally, when choosing the first number for our triplet, if this number is the same as the previous number, we can skip it. This is because any valid triplets including this number would have already been found in the previous iteration. These steps effectively eliminate duplicate solutions in the final result set.

###### ID39

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: A

The time complexity is O(n^2) because we iterate through the array once (which is O(n)), and for each iteration, we potentially go through the rest of the array using the two-pointer approach (which is also O(n)), thus resulting in O(n^2). The space complexity is O(1) since we aren't using additional space, other than the output.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

___

The problem is about finding two lines that together with the x-axis form a container such that the container contains the most water. Which of the following is the key factor that determines the amount of water a container can hold?

A) The height of the shortest line

B) The height of the tallest line

C) The distance between the two lines

D) Both A and C

###### ID40

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: D

The amount of water a container can hold is determined by the height of the shortest line (since water will overflow from the shorter line) and the distance between the two lines (since a wider container can hold more water).

Consider a brute-force solution where you calculate the area for all possible pairs of lines. What would be the time complexity of such an approach?

A) O(n)

B) O(n log n)

C) O(n^2)

D) O(2^n)

###### ID41

A:: =============================================

When considering the parameters that affect the amount of water a container can hold, we know that the distance between the two lines is important. Given this, where should we initially place the two pointers in order to maximize the chance of finding the largest possible area?

A) In the middle of the array

B) At the shortest and tallest lines

C) At the two ends of the array

D) At random positions in the array

###### ID42

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: C

To maximize the initial area, we should start with the widest possible container, by placing the two pointers at the two ends of the array. This allows us to be greedy and maximize the distance between the two lines. From there, we can move the pointers inward to explore other possible containers.

___

Given the array height = \[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7\], we start with the widest container, i.e., the first and the last line. Why is it impossible for us to find a new maximum area by leaving the left pointer at index = 0, and shifting the right pointer inwards?

A) Because the new container would be narrower but not taller.

B) Because the new container would be both narrower and taller.

C) Because the new container would be wider and not shorter.

###### ID43

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: A

The amount of water a container can hold is determined by the height of the shorter line. If we move the pointer at the taller line, the new container will be narrower (since the distance between the lines decreases), and it can't be taller (since the height is still limited by the shorter line). Therefore, there’s no need to consider anymore containers where the left pointer is at index = 0, since they will always be smaller than the current maximum.

___

The two-pointer technique ensures that we don't need to enumerate all n^2 combinations of pointers to find the maximal solution. How does the technique achieve this?

A) By ensuring that every element in the array is guaranteed to have a pointer land on it at some point.

B) By skipping combinations that will never lead to a more maximal solution.

C) Both A and B.

D) None of the above.

###### ID44

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: C

The two-pointer technique starts with the widest possible container and moves the pointers inward, always choosing the pointer at the shorter line to move. This ensures that every element in the array is guaranteed to have a pointer land on it at some point. It also avoids unnecessary combinations by skipping those that won't lead to a larger area (i.e., those where the container would be narrower but not taller). This solution is based on a ‘proof by contradiction’. Since we are being greedy and only skipping combinations that won’t lead to a new maximum, we are guaranteed to find the solution.

What is the time and space complexity of the solution using the two-pointer technique?

A) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)

B) Time complexity: O(n log n), Space complexity: O(n)

C) Time complexity: O(n^2), Space complexity: O(1)

D) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)

###### ID45

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: D

The two-pointer solution has a time complexity of O(n) because you need to iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use two pointers and a few variables to keep track of the maximum area, regardless of the size of the input array.

Q:: =============================================  

##### You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

_Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`._

Example 1:

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

___

What is the brute-force approach to solving this problem?

A) Sorting the array and running binary search to find the difference between the minimum and maximum prices.

B) Calculating the profit for each valid pair of buying and selling days, and finding the maximum profit.

C) Sorting the array and finding the difference between the minimum and maximum prices.

D) Creating a new array with the differences between consecutive prices and finding the maximum difference.

###### ID46

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

The correct brute-force approach is to calculate the profit for each valid pair of buying and selling days, and then find the maximum profit. For each day, we calculate the profit for every other day in the future. We keep track of the maximum profit seen.

Q:: =============================================  

##### You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

_Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`._

Example 1:

```

Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

___

We can also solve this by iterating through the array once, while keeping track of just two values. What two values should we keep track of to maximize the profit?

A) The maximum and minimum prices in the array.

B) The minimum price found so far and the maximum profit found so far.

C) The difference between each pair of prices and the maximum price found so far.

D) The maximum profit found so far and the index of the minimum price found so far.

###### ID47

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

We should keep track of the minimum price found so far and the maximum profit found so far. By keeping track of these two values, we can calculate the maximum potential profit at each step while iterating through the array.

Q:: =============================================  

##### You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

```

___

How will we use the minimum price found so far and the maximum profit found so far to efficiently solve this problem?

A) Using Kadane’s greedy algorithm.

B) Find the minimum price in the array, and for every other price compute the profit, until we find the maximum profit.

C) Iterate through the prices, if we find a new minimum price then update it. Compute the profit between the current price and the minimum price, if it exceeds the maximum profit, then update it.

###### ID48

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: C

We iterate through the prices, and for each price, if it is lower than the current minimum price, we update the minimum price. Then, we compute the profit by subtracting the current minimum from the current price. If this profit is greater than the current maximum profit, we update the maximum profit.

```

A) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)

B) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(m)

C) Time complexity: O(n^2), Space complexity: O(m)

###### ID56

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

Using the sliding window approach, we essentially scan through the string once with two pointers, making the time complexity O(n). The space complexity is O(m) because, in the worst-case scenario, the set used to check for repeating characters can contain all the distinct characters in the string, where m is the number of distinct characters.

#### Chapter 3 - Longest Repeating Character Replacement (Blind)

What is a brute force solution to this problem?

A) Iterate from the end of the string to the beginning, checking for duplicate characters.

B) For each substring, find the frequency of the most common character (maxf) and check if the length of the substring minus maxf is less than or equal to k.

###### ID57

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

The brute force solution would be to generate all possible substrings and for each substring, find the frequency of the most common character. If the length of the substring minus the frequency of the most common character is less than or equal to k, then the substring is valid (since we can change at most k characters to make all characters in the substring the same). We would then keep track of the maximum length of such valid substrings.

Q:: =============================================  

##### You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return _the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exists other ways to achive this answer too.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
-   `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
-   `0 <= k <= s.length`

___

What kind of data structure could help us track the frequency of each character in the current window of our string?

A) Queue

B) Array

C) Hash Map

D) Either B or C

###### ID58

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: D

Both an Array and a Hash Map can be used to efficiently count the frequency of elements. By keeping a frequency count of characters in our current window, we can determine the most frequent character. In the case of an Array, we could use each index to represent a unique character from the string (i.e., 'A' to 'Z' mapped to 0 to 25). In the case of a Hash Map, we would use the character itself as the key and the frequency as the value. Both methods allow us to update and access the frequency of each character in constant time.

___

Considering an efficient approach, what strategy could we use to solve this problem efficiently?

A) Divide and Conquer

B) Two pointers with sliding window

C) Recursion

###### ID59

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

The two pointers with sliding window strategy allows us to scan through the string in linear time complexity while keeping track of the longest substring with the same letters. The sliding window size changes based on the character frequency and the number of operations allowed.

If our current window size minus the frequency of the most common character is greater than k, what should we do?

A) Expand the window from the right

B) Shrink the window from the left

C) Increase k

D) Change the character at the left of the window

###### ID60

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

If the window size minus the frequency of the most common character is greater than k, it means we cannot make all characters the same in this window by changing k characters. Therefore, we need to shrink the window from the left.

Considering that the given string only contains uppercase English letters (from A to Z), what would be the time complexity of finding the most frequent character in the window?

A) O(1)

B) O(n)

C) O(logn)

###### ID61

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: A

Since we know that the string only contains uppercase English letters, there can be at most 26 unique characters. Thus, if we were to iterate through each unique character in our frequency dictionary or array to find the most frequent one, the time complexity would be O(26), which is essentially constant time, O(1).

What is the time and space complexity of the sliding window approach for this problem? Assume `n` is the length of the string.

```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        l = 0
        count = [0] * 26
        for r in range(len(s)):
            count[ord(s[r]) - ord('A')] += 1
            while (r - l + 1) - max(count) > k:
                count[ord(s[l]) - ord('A')] -= 1
                l += 1
            res = max(res, r - l + 1)
        return res
```

A) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)

B) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)

C) Time complexity: O(n^2), Space complexity: O(1)

###### ID62

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: A

The sliding window approach only scans the string once, and the time complexity is therefore O(n). The space complexity is O(1) because the count array always has a fixed size of 26, corresponding to the number of uppercase English letters. Even though we're dealing with a string of n characters, we're only ever tracking a maximum of 26 different ones.

How can we determine if our current window contains all characters of `t` without iterating through the entire hashmap?

A) By checking if the length of the window is greater than or equal to the length of \`t\`

B) By keeping track of two variables: the number of unique characters we have from \`t\` in our current window and the total unique characters needed from \`t\`

C) By sorting the hashmap and comparing it with \`t\`

###### ID68

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

By maintaining two variables, \`have\` and \`need\`, we can efficiently check if our window contains all characters of \`t\`. \`need\` is the number of unique characters in \`t\`, and \`have\` is the number of unique characters in \`t\` that our window currently contains. Each time we add a character to our window that makes the count of that character match what's needed in \`t\`, we increment \`have\`. We know our window contains all characters of \`t\` when \`have\` equals \`need\`.

```

A) Time complexity: O(n+m), Space complexity: O(1)

B) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)

C) Time complexity: O(n^2), Space complexity: O(m)

###### ID69

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: A

The time complexity is O(n+m) as we go through both s and t once. The space complexity is O(1) because the countT and window dictionaries will at most contain 52 unique keys, corresponding to the 26 lowercase and 26 uppercase English letters, which is a constant number and does not grow with n or m.

___

At any point in the string, we can only close the most recent open bracket, and after we close a bracket we then want to close the next most recent open bracket. Which data structure would be most useful here?

A) Hashmap

B) Stack

C) Queue

D) Binary Tree

###### ID71

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

A Stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure, which aligns well with this problem's requirements. When dealing with nested structures, like brackets, the most recently opened bracket must be the first one to be closed. This 'last opened, first closed' pattern is a characteristic behavior of a Stack, making it a suitable data structure to handle such scenarios.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Given a string s containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.  
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.  
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
-   `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`

___

Assume we iterate through the string s and we maintain a stack. What should we do when we encounter an open bracket?

A) Ignore it.

B) Check if it matches with the top element of the stack.

C) Push it onto the stack.

D) Pop the top element from the stack.

###### ID72

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: C

When we encounter an open bracket, we should push it onto the stack. The stack is used to keep track of the open brackets that we have encountered but not yet closed.

D) Check if it matches with the bottom element of the stack.

###### ID73

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: C

When we encounter a closing bracket, we should pop the top element from the stack and check if it is the matching opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If it is, we can continue; if it's not, or if the stack is empty, then the string is not valid.

After reaching the end of s, how do we know if the string is valid?

A) If the stack is empty.

B) If the stack is not empty.

C) If the last element in the stack is an open bracket.

D) If the last element in the stack is a closing bracket.

###### ID74

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: A

If we have managed to close all open brackets while iterating through the string, the stack should be empty at the end. If the stack is not empty, it means there are some open brackets that were not closed, so the string is not valid.

What is the time and space complexity of the solution using a stack? Assume the length of the input string is n.

A) Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

B) Time: O(n), Space: O(n)

C) Time: O(n), Space: O(n^2)

D) Time: O(n^2), Space: O(n)

###### ID75

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

We are iterating through the string only once, where n is the length of the string. For each character, we are performing a constant amount of work (either pushing onto the stack or popping from it). Hence, the time complexity is O(n). In the worst-case scenario, all characters in the string are opening brackets, and we push all of them onto the stack. Hence, the space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.

The binary search approach has a time complexity of O(log n) because in each step, you reduce the problem size by half. The space complexity is O(1) because you are not using any additional space that scales with the input size. You only need a constant amount of space to store the variables left, right, and mid.

#### Chapter 5 - Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (Blind)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]` might become:

-   `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
-   `[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]` if it was rotated `7` times.  
    Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
```

**Constraints:**

-   `n == nums.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 5000`
-   `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
-   All the integers of `nums` are unique.

Suppose we have a _normal_ sorted integer array. What is the time complexity to find the minimum element in this array?

A) O(n)

B) O(log n)

C) O(n^2)

D) O(1)

###### ID85

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: D

In a sorted array, the minimum element is always at the beginning, which can be found in constant time, O(1).

Q:: =============================================  

##### Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]` might become:

-   `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
-   `[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]` if it was rotated `7` times.  
    Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
```

**Constraints:**

-   `n == nums.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 5000`
-   `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
-   All the integers of `nums` are unique.

B) The right sorted portion

###### ID88

A) nums\[m\]

B) nums\[l\]

C) nums\[r\]

D) None of the above.

###### ID89

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

In a normal sorted array, the leftmost element is the minimum. In our case, if the original array is rotated n times, the minimum will be nums\[0\]. Alternatively, as we run binary search, if the current subarray of our search is a normal sorted array, we can end the binary search.

###### ID92

A:: =============================================  
**Answer**: B

The binary search approach has a time complexity of O(log n) because in each step, you reduce the problem size by half. The space complexity is O(1) because you are not using any additional space that scales with the input size. You only need a constant amount of space to store the variables left, right, and mid.
