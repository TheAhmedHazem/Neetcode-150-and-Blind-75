========== Question ==========  

### Sum of Two Integers

<details><summary><b>ðŸ“„ Description</b></summary><br>

Given two integers `a` and `b`, return the sum of the two integers without using the `+` and `-` operators.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = 1, b = 1

Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = 4, b = 7

Output: 11
```

**Constraints:**

-   `-1000 <= a, b <= 1000`

What's the key insight to solving this problem?

A) Understanding that addition can be decomposed into XOR and carry operations

B) Recognizing that subtraction is easier than addition with bitwise operations

C) Using multiplication instead of addition

D) Converting integers to strings  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

The key insight is understanding that binary addition can be broken down into two steps: 1) XORing the bits (addition without carry) and 2) handling the carries separately. By iteratively applying these two steps, we can compute the sum without using + or -.
