### Sum of Two Integers

<details><summary><b>ðŸ“„ Description</b></summary><br>

Given two integers `a` and `b`, return the sum of the two integers without using the `+` and `-` operators.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = 1, b = 1

Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = 4, b = 7

Output: 11
```

**Constraints:**

-   `-1000 <= a, b <= 1000`

What bitwise operation can be used to find the carry bits when adding two integers?

A) Bitwise AND (&)

B) Bitwise OR (|)

C) Bitwise XOR (^)

D) Bitwise NOT (~)  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

Bitwise AND (&) identifies positions where both bits are 1, which is exactly where a carry will be generated in binary addition. For example, 1 & 1 = 1 (carry generated) and 1 & 0 = 0 & 1 = 0 & 0 = 0 (no carry).
