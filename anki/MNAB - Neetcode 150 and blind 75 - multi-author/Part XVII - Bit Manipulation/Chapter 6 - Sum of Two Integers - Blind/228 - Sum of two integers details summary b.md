### Sum of Two Integers

<details><summary><b>ðŸ“„ Description</b></summary><br>

Given two integers `a` and `b`, return the sum of the two integers without using the `+` and `-` operators.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = 1, b = 1

Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = 4, b = 7

Output: 11
```

**Constraints:**

-   `-1000 <= a, b <= 1000`

In the iterative approach to solve the "Sum of Two Integers" problem, when do we stop the loop?

A) When the result becomes 0

B) When the carry becomes 0

C) After a fixed number of iterations

D) When both a and b become 0  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

The iterative approach continues until there are no more carries to propagate. Once the carry becomes 0, it means that all bits have been properly added and no further additions are needed.

========== Id ==========  
228
