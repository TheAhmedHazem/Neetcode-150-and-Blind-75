### Sum of Two Integers

<details><summary><b>ðŸ“„ Description</b></summary><br>

Given two integers `a` and `b`, return the sum of the two integers without using the `+` and `-` operators.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = 1, b = 1

Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = 4, b = 7

Output: 11
```

**Constraints:**

-   `-1000 <= a, b <= 1000`

</details>

If a = 5 and b = 3, what will be the value of the first XOR operation (a ^ b)?

A) 2

B) 6

C) 7

D) 8  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

In binary: 5 is 101 and 3 is 011. XORing these gives: 101 ^ 011 = 110, which is 6 in decimal. This represents the sum without considering carries.
