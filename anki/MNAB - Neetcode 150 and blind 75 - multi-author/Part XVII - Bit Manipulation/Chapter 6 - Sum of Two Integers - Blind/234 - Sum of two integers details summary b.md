========== Question ==========  

### Sum of Two Integers

<details><summary><b>ðŸ“„ Description</b></summary><br>

Given two integers `a` and `b`, return the sum of the two integers without using the `+` and `-` operators.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = 1, b = 1

Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = 4, b = 7

Output: 11
```

**Constraints:**

-   `-1000 <= a, b <= 1000`

</details>

If a = 5 and b = 3, what will be the value of the first carry operation ((a & b) << 1)?

A) 1

B) 2

C) 4

D) 8  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

In binary: 5 is 101 and 3 is 011. ANDing gives: 101 & 011 = 001. Left shifting by 1: 001 << 1 = 010, which is 2 in decimal. This represents the carries shifted to their correct positions.

========== Id ==========  
234
