### Find Target in Rotated Sorted Array

You are given an array of length `n` which was originally sorted in ascending order. It has now been **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]` might become:

-   `[3,4,5,6,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.

-   `[1,2,3,4,5,6]` if it was rotated `6` times.

Given the rotated sorted array `nums` and an integer `target`, return the index of `target` within `nums`, or `-1` if it is not present.

You may assume all elements in the sorted rotated array `nums` are **unique**,

A solution that runs in `O(n)` time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time`?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,1,2], target = 1
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,5,6,0,1,2], target = 4
Output: -1
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`

-   `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

-   `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

Now consider a sorted array that has been rotated at an unknown index. What is the time complexity of the _simplest_ (but non-optimal) solution to find an element in this array?

A) O(n)

B) O(log n)

C) O(n^2)

D) O(1)  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

The simplest solution would be to perform a linear search, which has a time complexity of O(n).
