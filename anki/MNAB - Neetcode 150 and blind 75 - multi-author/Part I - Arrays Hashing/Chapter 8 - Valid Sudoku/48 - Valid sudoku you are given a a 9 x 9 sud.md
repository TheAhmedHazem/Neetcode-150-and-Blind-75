========== Question ==========  

### Valid Sudoku

You are given a a `9 x 9` Sudoku board `board`. A Sudoku board is valid if the following rules are followed:

1.  Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without duplicates.

2.  Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without duplicates.

3.  Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without duplicates.

Return `true` if the Sudoku board is valid, otherwise return `false`

Note: A board does not need to be full or be solvable to be valid.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board =
[["1","2",".",".","3",".",".",".","."],
 ["4",".",".","5",".",".",".",".","."],
 [".","9","8",".",".",".",".",".","3"],
 ["5",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","4"],
 [".",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","5"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".",".",".",".",".",".","2",".","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","8"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: board =
[["1","2",".",".","3",".",".",".","."],
 ["4",".",".","5",".",".",".",".","."],
 [".","9","1",".",".",".",".",".","3"],
 ["5",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","4"],
 [".",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","5"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".",".",".",".",".",".","2",".","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","8"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
```

Explanation: There are two 1's in the top-left 3x3 sub-box.

**Constraints:**

-   `board.length == 9`

-   `board[i].length == 9`

-   `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.

How should empty cells (marked as '.') be handled?

A) Treat them as zeros

B) Skip them during validation

C) Replace them with valid numbers

D) Mark them as invalid  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

Empty cells should be skipped during validation because:

1. The problem states a board doesn't need to be full to be valid

2. Only filled cells need to be checked for duplicates

3. Empty cells don't affect the validity of the current board state

4. This matches the requirements that we're only checking validity, not solvability
