========== Question ==========  

### Valid Sudoku

You are given a a `9 x 9` Sudoku board `board`. A Sudoku board is valid if the following rules are followed:

1.  Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without duplicates.

2.  Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without duplicates.

3.  Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without duplicates.

Return `true` if the Sudoku board is valid, otherwise return `false`

Note: A board does not need to be full or be solvable to be valid.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board =
[["1","2",".",".","3",".",".",".","."],
 ["4",".",".","5",".",".",".",".","."],
 [".","9","8",".",".",".",".",".","3"],
 ["5",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","4"],
 [".",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","5"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".",".",".",".",".",".","2",".","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","8"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]

Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: board =
[["1","2",".",".","3",".",".",".","."],
 ["4",".",".","5",".",".",".",".","."],
 [".","9","1",".",".",".",".",".","3"],
 ["5",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","4"],
 [".",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","5"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".",".",".",".",".",".","2",".","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","8"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]

Output: false
```

Explanation: There are two 1's in the top-left 3x3 sub-box.

**Constraints:**

-   `board.length == 9`

-   `board[i].length == 9`

-   `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.

What is the most efficient data structure to track seen digits in a row, column, or 3x3 box?

A) Array

B) HashMap

C) HashSet

D) LinkedList  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: C

A HashSet is ideal because:

1. O(1) lookup time to check if a digit exists

2. O(1) insertion time to add new digits

3. Automatically handles duplicates

4. Easy to clear for checking each new row/column/box

========== Id ==========  
42
