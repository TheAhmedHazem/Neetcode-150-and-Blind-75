### Valid Sudoku

You are given a a `9 x 9` Sudoku board `board`. A Sudoku board is valid if the following rules are followed:

1.  Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without duplicates.

2.  Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without duplicates.

3.  Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without duplicates.

Return `true` if the Sudoku board is valid, otherwise return `false`

Note: A board does not need to be full or be solvable to be valid.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board =
[["1","2",".",".","3",".",".",".","."],
 ["4",".",".","5",".",".",".",".","."],
 [".","9","8",".",".",".",".",".","3"],
 ["5",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","4"],
 [".",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","5"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".",".",".",".",".",".","2",".","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","8"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: board =
[["1","2",".",".","3",".",".",".","."],
 ["4",".",".","5",".",".",".",".","."],
 [".","9","1",".",".",".",".",".","3"],
 ["5",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","4"],
 [".",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","5"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".",".",".",".",".",".","2",".","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","8"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
```

Explanation: There are two 1's in the top-left 3x3 sub-box.

**Constraints:**

-   `board.length == 9`

-   `board[i].length == 9`

-   `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.

How can you efficiently determine which 3x3 sub-box a cell belongs to?

A) Using modulo and division operations on indices

B) Using a separate lookup table

C) Using nested loops

D) Using binary search  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

Using modulo and division operations is most efficient because:

1. box_row = row / 3 (integer division)

2. box_col = col / 3 (integer division)

3. This gives a unique identifier for each 3x3 box in O(1) time

4. No additional space or lookup tables needed
