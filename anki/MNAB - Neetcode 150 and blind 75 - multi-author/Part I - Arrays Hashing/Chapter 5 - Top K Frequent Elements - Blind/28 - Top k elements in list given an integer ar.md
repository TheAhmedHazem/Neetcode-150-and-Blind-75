### Top K Elements in List

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements within the array.

The test cases are generated such that the answer is always **unique**.

You may return the output in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3], k = 2
Output: [2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [7,7], k = 1
Output: [7]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`.

-   `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

-   `1 <= k <= number of distinct elements in nums`.

What is the space complexity of the entire solution using a hashmap and a heap?

A) O(1)

B) O(k)

C) O(n)

D) O(n + k)  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: C

The space complexity is O(n) because:

1. The hashmap stores at most n different elements and their frequencies

2. The heap stores at most k elements, where k â‰¤ n

Therefore, O(n) dominates O(k), making the total space complexity O(n).
