========== Question ==========  

### Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

-   `10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

How many possible pairs of elements are there in an array of size n?

A) log n

B) n

C) n^2

D) 2^n  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: C

There are exactly n \* (n - 1) / 2 distinct pairs of integers in the array. This is equivalent to (n^2 - n) / 2, and we normally consider the largest term, which in this case is n^2.

========== Id ==========  
1
