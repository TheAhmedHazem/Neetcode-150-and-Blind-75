### String Encode and Decode

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement `encode` and `decode`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]
Output:["neet","code","love","you"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]
Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= strs.length < 100`

-   `0 <= strs[i].length < 200`

-   `strs[i]` contains only UTF-8 characters.

---

Given the constraint that `strs[i]` can contain any valid ASCII characters, including special ones, which encoding strategy should we use to ensure that our encoded message can be correctly decoded?

A) Separate strings in strs using a special character, such as a comma or a space.

B) Use a length-prefix followed by a special character for each string in strs.

C) Concatenate all the strings in strs directly.  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

If we use a special character to separate the strings, it could be a problem if the string itself contains this special character. If we concatenate the strings directly, we can't distinguish where one string ends and another begins. Therefore, prefixing each string with its length followed by a special character allows us to correctly separate the strings during decoding, even if they contain special characters.
