========== Question ==========  

### Is Anagram

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return `false`.

An **anagram** is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

-   `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

What is the primary characteristic of an anagram?

A) Both words have the same length.

B) Both words have the same letters, in the same quantities.

C) Both words have the same first letter.

D) Both words have the same last letter.  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. This means both words have the same letters, in the same quantities. For example, 'Heart' is an anagram of 'Earth'.
