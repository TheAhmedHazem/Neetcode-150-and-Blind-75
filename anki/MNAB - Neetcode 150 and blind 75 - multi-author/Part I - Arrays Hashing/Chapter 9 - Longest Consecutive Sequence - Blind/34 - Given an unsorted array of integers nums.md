========== Question ==========  

### Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the _length of the longest consecutive elements sequence_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

-   `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

What is the time and space complexity of the optimal solution using a HashSet and avoiding unnecessary checks?

A) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)

B) Time complexity: O(n log n), Space complexity: O(n)

C) Time complexity: O(n^2), Space complexity: O(1)

D) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

The HashSet solution has a time complexity of O(n) because you need to iterate through the array twice (once for building the HashSet and once for checking the sequences). The space complexity is also O(n) because, in the worst case, you might need to store all n elements in the HashSet.
