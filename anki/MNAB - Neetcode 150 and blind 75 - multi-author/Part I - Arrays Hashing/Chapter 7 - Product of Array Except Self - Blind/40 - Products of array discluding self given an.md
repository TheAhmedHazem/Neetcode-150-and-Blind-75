### Products of Array Discluding Self

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `output` where `output[i]` is the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

Each product is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

Follow-up: Could you solve it in `O(n)` time without using the division operation?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,4,6]
Output: [48,24,12,8]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,3]
Output: [0,-6,0,0,0]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`

-   `-20 <= nums[i] <= 20`

Why is division not allowed as a solution approach?

A) Division is computationally expensive

B) To make the problem more challenging

C) To prevent potential division by zero errors

D) To force a more optimal solution that demonstrates understanding of array manipulation  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: D

The restriction on division is meant to:

1. Prevent a trivial O(n) solution with total product division

2. Test the candidate's ability to manipulate arrays creatively

3. Demonstrate understanding of prefix and suffix product calculations

4. Explore more advanced array processing techniques
