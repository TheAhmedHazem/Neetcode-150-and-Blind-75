### Depth of Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its **depth**.

The **depth** of a binary tree is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 100`.

-   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

What is the maximum depth of a binary tree with a single node?

A) 0

B) 1

C) 2

D) The depth is undefined for a single node tree.  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

A tree with a single node (which is also the root) has a maximum depth of 1. The depth of a tree is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. Here, that path consists only of the root node itself.
