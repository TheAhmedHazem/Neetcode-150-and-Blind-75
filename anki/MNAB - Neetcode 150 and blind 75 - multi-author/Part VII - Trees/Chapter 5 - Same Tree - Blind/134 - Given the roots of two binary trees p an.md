========== Question ==========  

### Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

![image](https://imagedelivery.net/CLfkmk9Wzy8_9HRyug4EVA/76cda15a-858b-4702-d319-badd1fb6da00/public)

```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`.

-   `10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

---

Which of the following factors would be considered when determining if two binary trees are the same?

A) The structure of the trees.

B) The values of the nodes in the trees.

C) Both A and B.  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: C

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

========== Id ==========
