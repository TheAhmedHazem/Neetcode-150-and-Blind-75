========== Question ==========  

### Invert a Binary Tree

You are given the root of a binary tree `root`. Invert the binary tree and return its root.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,3,2,7,6,5,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [3,2,1]
Output: [3,1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 100`.

-   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

Inverting a binary tree means to make all left child nodes become right child nodes and vice versa. This is effectively the same as swapping the left and right child nodes for every node in the tree.
