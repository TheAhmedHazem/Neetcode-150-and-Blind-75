========== Question ==========  

### You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

_Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1-&gt;4-&gt;5,
  1-&gt;3-&gt;4,
  2-&gt;6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: lists = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

- `k == lists.length`

- `0 <= k <= 10^4`

- `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`

- `10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`

- `lists[i]` is sorted in **ascending order**.

- The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

Considering the recursive approach, how would we compute the maximum depth of a
binary tree?

A) Compare the depth of the left subtree and the right subtree, then return the
maximum plus 1

B) Add the depths of the left subtree and the right subtree

C) Return the depth of the left subtree if it is non-null, else return the depth
of the right subtree  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

The maximum depth of a binary tree is one more than the maximum of the depths of
its left and right subtrees. So, we recursively compute the maximum depths of
the left and right subtrees, and the maximum depth of the tree is the maximum of
these two depths plus 1.
