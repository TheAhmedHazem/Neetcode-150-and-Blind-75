========== Question ==========  

### You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

_Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1-&gt;4-&gt;5,
  1-&gt;3-&gt;4,
  2-&gt;6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: lists = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

- `k == lists.length`

- `0 <= k <= 10^4`

- `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`

- `10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`

- `lists[i]` is sorted in **ascending order**.

- The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

If we use a recursive DFS approach to solve this problem, what would be a
sensible base case?

A) When we encounter a null node

B) When we encounter a node with only one child

C) There is no need for a base case  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

A good base case for this problem could be when we encounter a null node. When
we reach a null node, it indicates we've traversed all the way down one path of
the tree and we've hit a leaf node in the previous step.

========== Id ==========  
146
