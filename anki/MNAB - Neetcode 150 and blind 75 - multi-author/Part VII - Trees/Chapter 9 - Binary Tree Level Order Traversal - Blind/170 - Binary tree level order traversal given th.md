### Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the level order traversal of its nodes' values_. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.

-   `1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

How would you traverse a binary tree in a level order fashion?

A) By using Depth-First Search (DFS)

B) By using Breadth-First Search (BFS)  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

Level order traversal of a binary tree is also known as Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal.
