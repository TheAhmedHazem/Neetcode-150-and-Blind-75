### Reverse a Linked List

Given the beginning of a singly linked list `head`, reverse the list, and return the new beginning of the list.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [0,1,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= The length of the list <= 1000`.

-   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

In order to reverse a linked list, we need to change the direction of which part of each node?

A)Â The node's value

B)Â The node's 'next' reference  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

In a singly linked list, each node has a value and a 'next' reference pointing to the next node in the list. To reverse the list, we need to change the 'next' reference of each node to point to the previous node.
