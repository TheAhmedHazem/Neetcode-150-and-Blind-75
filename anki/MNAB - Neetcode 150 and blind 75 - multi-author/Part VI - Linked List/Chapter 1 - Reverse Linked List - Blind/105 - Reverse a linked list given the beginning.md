### Reverse a Linked List

Given the beginning of a singly linked list `head`, reverse the list, and return the new beginning of the list.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [0,1,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= The length of the list <= 1000`.

-   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

If we have a linked list with only one node, what will be the result after reversing it?

A)Â An empty linked list

B)Â The same linked list  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

Reversing a linked list with only one node doesn't change anything. It remains the same, as there are no other nodes to rearrange.

========== Id ==========  
105
