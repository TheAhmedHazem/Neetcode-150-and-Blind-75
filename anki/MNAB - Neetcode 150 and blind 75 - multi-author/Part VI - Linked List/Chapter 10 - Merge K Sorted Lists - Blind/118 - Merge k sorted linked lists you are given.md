========== Question ==========  

### Merge K Sorted Linked Lists

You are given an array of `k` linked lists `lists`, where each list is sorted in ascending order.

Return the **sorted** linked list that is the result of merging all of the individual linked lists.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,2,4],[1,3,5],[3,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,3,4,5,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: lists = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= lists.length <= 1000`

-   `0 <= lists[i].length <= 100`

-   `-1000 <= lists[i][j] <= 1000`

What would be a straightforward but not necessarily optimal approach to solve this problem?

A) Sequentially merge the linked lists, starting from the first one

B) Reverse each linked list, and then merge

C) Select the last node from each list and create a new sorted list

D) Randomly pick two lists to merge until one list is left  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

A straightforward approach for this problem would involve sequentially merging the linked lists, starting from the first one. This would involve merging the first two lists, then merging the result with the third list, and so on. While this approach is simple, it may not be the most efficient in terms of time complexity.
