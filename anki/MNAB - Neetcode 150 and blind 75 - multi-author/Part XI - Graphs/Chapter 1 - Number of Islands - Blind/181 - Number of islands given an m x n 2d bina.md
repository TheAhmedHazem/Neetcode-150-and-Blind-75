### Number of Islands

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

What happens if we donâ€™t mark a piece of land as visited after visiting it?

A) We will get stuck in an infinite recusive call stack (timeout or stackoverflow).

B) We will count the same island multiple times.

C) We may miss counting some of the islands.  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

If we don't mark a piece of land as visited after visiting it, our DFS or BFS traversal will revisit the same cell again and again. This would eventually result in a timeout or stackoverflow error.
