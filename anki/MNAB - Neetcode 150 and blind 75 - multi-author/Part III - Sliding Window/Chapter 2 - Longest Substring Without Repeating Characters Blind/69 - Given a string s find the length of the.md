========== Question ==========  

### Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`

- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

Considering the constraint that `s` consists of English letters, digits,
symbols, and spaces, what is the maximum possible size of our window?

A) 26

B) 52

C) 95  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: C

In ASCII, there are 95 printable characters: 26 lowercase English letters, 26
uppercase English letters, 10 digits (0-9), 32 special characters and symbols,
and the space character. This makes a total of 95 unique characters. Even if you
don’t know there are exactly 95, it reasonable that there would be more than 52
(26 uppercase, 26 lowercase).

========== Id ==========  
69
