### Max Water Container

You are given an integer array `heights` where `heights[i]` represents the height of the ithi^{th}ith bar.

You may choose any two bars to form a container. Return the _maximum_ amount of water a container can store.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: height = [1,7,2,5,4,7,3,6]
Output: 36
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [2,2,2]
Output: 4
```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= height.length <= 1000`

-   `0 <= height[i] <= 1000`

What is the time and space complexity of the solution using the two-pointer technique?

A) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)

B) Time complexity: O(n log n), Space complexity: O(n)

C) Time complexity: O(n^2), Space complexity: O(1)

D) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: D

The two-pointer solution has a time complexity of O(n) because you need to iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use two pointers and a few variables to keep track of the maximum area, regardless of the size of the input array.
