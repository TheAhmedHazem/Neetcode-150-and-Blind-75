========== Question ==========  

### A phrase is a **palindrome** if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a **palindrome,** or `false`
otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
```

**Constraints:**

`1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5`

`s consists only of printable ASCII characters.`

What is the time and space complexity of the approach where we create a new
reversed string to compare?

A) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)

B) Time complexity: O(n log n), Space complexity: O(n)

C) Time complexity: O(n^2), Space complexity: O(1)

D) Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

The time complexity is O(n) because all operations (lowercase conversion,
removing non-alphanumeric characters, and reversing the string) take linear
time. The 'n' here is the length of the string. The space complexity is also
O(n) because we are creating a new string for the reversed version, which can be
as long as the input string.
