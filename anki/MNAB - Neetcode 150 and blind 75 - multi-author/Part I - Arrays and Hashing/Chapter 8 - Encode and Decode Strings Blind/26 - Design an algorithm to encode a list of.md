========== Question ==========  

### Design an algorithm to encode **a list of strings** to **a string**. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement `encode` and `decode`

**Example1**

```
Input: dummy_input = ["Hello", "World"]
Output: ["Hello", "World"]
Explanation:
Machine 1:
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String msg = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 1 ---msg---&gt; Machine 2
Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String[] strs = decoder.decode(msg);
```

**Example2**

```
Input: dummy_input = [""]
Output: [""]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`

- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`

- `strs[i] contains any possible characters out of 256 valid ASCII characters`

---

Given the constraint that `strs[i]` can contain any valid ASCII characters,
including special ones, which encoding strategy should we use to ensure that our
encoded message can be correctly decoded?

A) Separate strings in strs using a special character, such as a comma or a
space.

B) Use a length-prefix followed by a special character for each string in strs.

C) Concatenate all the strings in strs directly.  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

If we use a special character to separate the strings, it could be a problem if
the string itself contains this special character. If we concatenate the strings
directly, we can't distinguish where one string ends and another begins.
Therefore, prefixing each string with its length followed by a special character
allows us to correctly separate the strings during decoding, even if they
contain special characters.
