========== Question ==========  

### Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

What is an alternative approach to grouping anagrams without sorting the
strings?

A) Using the product of prime numbers to represent each string

B) Using bit manipulation to represent each string

C) Using a trie data structure to represent each string

D) Using a heap data structure to represent each string  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

An alternative approach to grouping anagrams without sorting the strings is to
use the product of prime numbers to represent each string. Each character in the
string is mapped to a unique prime number, and the product of the prime numbers
corresponding to the characters in the string is used as a key in a dictionary.
Strings that are anagrams of each other will have the same product of prime
numbers, and they can be grouped together using this product as the key.
