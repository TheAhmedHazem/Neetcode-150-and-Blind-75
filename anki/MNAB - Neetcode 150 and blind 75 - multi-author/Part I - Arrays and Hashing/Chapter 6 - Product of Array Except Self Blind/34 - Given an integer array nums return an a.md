========== Question ==========  

### Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `output` where `output[i]` is the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

Each product is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

Follow-up: Could you solve it in `O(n)` time without using the division
operation?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,4,6]
Output: [48,24,12,8]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,3]
Output: [0,-6,0,0,0]
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`

- `-20 <= nums[i] <= 20`

What is a key insight to solve this problem efficiently without using division?

A) Use a stack to keep track of products

B) Use a prefix and suffix product approach

C) Sort the array first

D) Use a binary search tree  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

The key insight is to use a prefix and suffix product approach. By calculating
the product of all elements to the left (prefix) and to the right (suffix) of
each element, we can efficiently compute the required product for each position
without using division.
