### Meeting Rooms II

Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times `[[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei)`, find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

**Example1**

```
Input: intervals = [(0,30),(5,10),(15,20)]
Output: 2
Explanation:
We need two meeting rooms
room1: (0,30)
room2: (5,10),(15,20)
```

**Example2**

```
Input: intervals = [(2,7)]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Only need one meeting room
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`

-   `intervals[i].length == 2`

-   `0 <= intervals[i][0] < intervals[i][1] <= 10^6`

As we iterate through these sorted arrays, `start` and `end`, how do we know if a meeting has ended?

A) start\[s\] < end\[e\]

B) start\[s\] == end\[e\]

C) end\[e\] <= start\[s\]  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: C

If the end time of the current earliest ending meeting (end\[e\]) is less than or equal to the start time of the next meeting (start\[s\]), it indicates that a current meeting has ended. We donâ€™t necessarily know the start time of this meeting, but we can still keep track of the number of ongoing meetings which is our goal.

========== Id ==========  
195
