### Minimum Window With Characters

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the shortest **substring** of `s` such that every character in `t`, including duplicates, is present in the substring. If such a substring does not exist, return an empty string `""`.

You may assume that the correct output is always unique.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "OUZODYXAZV", t = "XYZ"
Output: "YXAZ"
```

Explanation: `"YXAZ"` is the shortest substring that includes `"X"`, `"Y"`, and `"Z"` from string `t`.

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "xyz", t = "xyz"
Output: "xyz"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "x", t = "xy"
Output: ""
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`

-   `1 <= t.length <= 1000`

-   `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

If our current window contains all characters of `t`, what should we do to find the smallest valid window?

A) Expand the window from the right

B) Shrink the window from the left

C) Expand the window from the left  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

If our current window already contains all characters of `t`, we try to shrink the window from the left to find the smallest window that still satisfies the condition. If we can't shrink it without losing a necessary character, we move on to expanding it from the right again.
