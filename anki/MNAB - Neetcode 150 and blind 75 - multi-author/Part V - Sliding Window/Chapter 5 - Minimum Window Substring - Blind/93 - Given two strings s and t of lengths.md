========== Question ==========  

### Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the _**minimum window substring**_ of `s` such that every character in `t` (_**including duplicates**_) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"a"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> t <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"aa"</span>
Output: <span class="token string">""</span>
Explanation: Both <span class="token string">'a'</span>s <span class="token keyword">from</span> t must be included <span class="token operator">in</span> the window<span class="token punctuation">.</span>
Since the largest window <span class="token keyword">of</span> s only has one <span class="token string">'a'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span> empty string<span class="token punctuation">.</span>
```

**Constraints:**

-   `m == s.length`

-   `n == t.length`

-   `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`

-   `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

What kind of data structure could help us track the frequency of each character in the current window of our string?

A) Linked List

B) Hash Map

C) Stack  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

A Hash Map is a good data structure to efficiently track the frequency of each character in the current window. By using the character itself as the key and the frequency as the value, we can access and update the frequency of each character in constant time.

========== Id ==========  
93
