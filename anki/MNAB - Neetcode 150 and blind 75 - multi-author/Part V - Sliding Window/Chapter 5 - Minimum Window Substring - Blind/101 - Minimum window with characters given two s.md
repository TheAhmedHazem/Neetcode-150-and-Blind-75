### Minimum Window With Characters

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the shortest **substring** of `s` such that every character in `t`, including duplicates, is present in the substring. If such a substring does not exist, return an empty string `""`.

You may assume that the correct output is always unique.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "OUZODYXAZV", t = "XYZ"
Output: "YXAZ"
```

Explanation: `"YXAZ"` is the shortest substring that includes `"X"`, `"Y"`, and `"Z"` from string `t`.

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "xyz", t = "xyz"
Output: "xyz"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "x", t = "xy"
Output: ""
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`

-   `1 <= t.length <= 1000`

-   `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

---

What should we do if our current window doesn't contain all characters of `t`?

A) Expand the window from the right

B) Shrink the window from the left

C) Remove the window and create a new one  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

If our current window does not contain all characters of `t`, it means we need to expand the window from the right in hope of including the missing characters.
