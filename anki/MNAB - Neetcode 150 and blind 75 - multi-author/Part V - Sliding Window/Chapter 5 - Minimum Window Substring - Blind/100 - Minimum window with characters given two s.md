### Minimum Window With Characters

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the shortest **substring** of `s` such that every character in `t`, including duplicates, is present in the substring. If such a substring does not exist, return an empty string `""`.

You may assume that the correct output is always unique.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "OUZODYXAZV", t = "XYZ"
Output: "YXAZ"
```

Explanation: `"YXAZ"` is the shortest substring that includes `"X"`, `"Y"`, and `"Z"` from string `t`.

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "xyz", t = "xyz"
Output: "xyz"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "x", t = "xy"
Output: ""
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`

-   `1 <= t.length <= 1000`

-   `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

Considering an efficient approach, what strategy could we use to solve this problem?

A) Divide and Conquer

B) Two Pointers with Sliding Window

C) Binary Search  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: B

The Two Pointers with Sliding Window strategy allows us to scan through the string in linear time complexity while keeping track of the smallest valid substring. We maintain a sliding window that always satisfies the condition of containing all characters of `t`.

========== Id ==========  
100
