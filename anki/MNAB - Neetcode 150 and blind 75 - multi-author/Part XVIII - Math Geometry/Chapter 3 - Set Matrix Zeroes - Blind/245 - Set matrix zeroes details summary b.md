### Set Matrix Zeroes

<details><summary><b>ðŸ“„ Description</b></summary><br>

Given an `m x n` matrix of integers `matrix`, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0`'s.

You must update the matrix _in-place_.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using `O(1)` space?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [
  [0,1],
  [1,0]
]

Output: [
  [0,0],
  [0,0]
]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://imagedelivery.net/CLfkmk9Wzy8_9HRyug4EVA/04d99cc8-e453-464d-888c-58d0a95daf00/public)

```
Input: matrix = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,0,5],
  [6,7,8]
]

Output: [
  [1,0,3],
  [0,0,0],
  [6,0,8]
]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= matrix.length, matrix[0].length <= 100`

-   `-2^31 <= matrix[i][j] <= (2^31) - 1`

What is the main insight for achieving the O(1) space solution?

A) Using recursion instead of iteration

B) Using binary search to find zeros

C) Using the matrix itself as the auxiliary space

D) Converting the problem to a graph traversal problem  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: C

The key insight for the O(1) space solution is to use the matrix itself as auxiliary space - specifically using the first row and column as markers for which other rows and columns should be zeroed. This eliminates the need for additional data structures while still keeping track of all necessary information.
