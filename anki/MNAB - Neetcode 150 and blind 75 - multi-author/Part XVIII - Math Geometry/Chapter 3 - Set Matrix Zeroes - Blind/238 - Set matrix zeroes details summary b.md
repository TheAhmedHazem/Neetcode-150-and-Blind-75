### Set Matrix Zeroes

<details><summary><b>ðŸ“„ Description</b></summary><br>

Given an `m x n` matrix of integers `matrix`, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0`'s.

You must update the matrix _in-place_.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using `O(1)` space?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [
  [0,1],
  [1,0]
]

Output: [
  [0,0],
  [0,0]
]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://imagedelivery.net/CLfkmk9Wzy8_9HRyug4EVA/04d99cc8-e453-464d-888c-58d0a95daf00/public)

```
Input: matrix = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,0,5],
  [6,7,8]
]

Output: [
  [1,0,3],
  [0,0,0],
  [6,0,8]
]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= matrix.length, matrix[0].length <= 100`

-   `-2^31 <= matrix[i][j] <= (2^31) - 1`

What constraint makes this problem challenging?

A) The requirement to update the matrix in-place

B) The large range of possible values in the matrix

C) The potential size of the matrix (up to 100x100)

D) The need for O(1) time complexity  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

The main challenge is that we need to update the matrix in-place, and the follow-up asks for an O(1) space solution. This constraint makes it tricky because we need a way to mark which rows and columns should be zeroed without using additional space.
