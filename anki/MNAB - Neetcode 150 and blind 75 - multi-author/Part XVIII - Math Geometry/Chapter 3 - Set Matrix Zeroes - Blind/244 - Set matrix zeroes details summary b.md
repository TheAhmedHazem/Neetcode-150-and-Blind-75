### Set Matrix Zeroes

<details><summary><b>ðŸ“„ Description</b></summary><br>

Given an `m x n` matrix of integers `matrix`, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0`'s.

You must update the matrix _in-place_.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using `O(1)` space?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [
  [0,1],
  [1,0]
]

Output: [
  [0,0],
  [0,0]
]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://imagedelivery.net/CLfkmk9Wzy8_9HRyug4EVA/04d99cc8-e453-464d-888c-58d0a95daf00/public)

```
Input: matrix = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,0,5],
  [6,7,8]
]

Output: [
  [1,0,3],
  [0,0,0],
  [6,0,8]
]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= matrix.length, matrix[0].length <= 100`

-   `-2^31 <= matrix[i][j] <= (2^31) - 1`

If a cell matrix[i][j] is zero, what action must be taken in the O(1) space approach?

A) Set matrix[i][0] and matrix[0][j] to zero immediately

B) Set matrix[i][0] and matrix[0][j] to a special marker value

C) Set matrix[i][0] and matrix[0][j] to zero, but only after processing all cells

D) Set the entire row i and column j to zero immediately  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: A

In the O(1) space approach, when we find a zero at matrix[i][j], we set matrix[i][0] and matrix[0][j] to zero as markers indicating that row i and column j need to be zeroed. However, we don't zero the entire row and column immediately, as that would interfere with our marking process.
