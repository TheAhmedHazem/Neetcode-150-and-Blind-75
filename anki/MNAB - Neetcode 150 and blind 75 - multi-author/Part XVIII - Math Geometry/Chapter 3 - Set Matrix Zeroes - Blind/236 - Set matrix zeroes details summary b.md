### Set Matrix Zeroes

<details><summary><b>ðŸ“„ Description</b></summary><br>

Given an `m x n` matrix of integers `matrix`, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0`'s.

You must update the matrix _in-place_.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using `O(1)` space?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [
  [0,1],
  [1,0]
]

Output: [
  [0,0],
  [0,0]
]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://imagedelivery.net/CLfkmk9Wzy8_9HRyug4EVA/04d99cc8-e453-464d-888c-58d0a95daf00/public)

```
Input: matrix = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,0,5],
  [6,7,8]
]

Output: [
  [1,0,3],
  [0,0,0],
  [6,0,8]
]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= matrix.length, matrix[0].length <= 100`

-   `-2^31 <= matrix[i][j] <= (2^31) - 1`

What is the time complexity of the brute force approach where you first mark all rows and columns to be zeroed in a separate data structure, then modify the matrix?

A) O(m + n)

B) O(m \* n)

C) O(m \* n \* (m + n))

D) O((m \* n)^2)  

========== Answer ==========  

**Answer**: C

The brute force approach requires first scanning the entire matrix once to identify zero positions (O(m\*n)), and then for each zero found, we need to set the entire row and column to zero (O(m+n) for each zero). In the worst case, we might need to process many zeros, leading to a time complexity of O(m\*n\*(m+n)).
