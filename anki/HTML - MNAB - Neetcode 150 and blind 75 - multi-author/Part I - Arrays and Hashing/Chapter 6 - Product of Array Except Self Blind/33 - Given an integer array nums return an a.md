==================== Question ====================  

### Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `output` where `output[i]` is the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

Each product is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

Follow-up: Could you solve it in `O(n)` time without using the division operation?

**Example 1:**

<!-- codeblock-start -->
<pre><code>Input: nums = [1,2,4,6]
Output: [48,24,12,8]
</code></pre>
<!-- codeblock-end -->

**Example 2:**

<!-- codeblock-start -->
<pre><code>Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,3]
Output: [0,-6,0,0,0]
</code></pre>
<!-- codeblock-end -->

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`

- `-20 <= nums[i] <= 20`

What is the time complexity of a naive approach where you calculate the product of all elements except the current one for each element?

A) O(n)

B) O(n log n)

C) O(n^2)

D) O(2^n)  

==================== Answer ====================  

**Answer**: C

The naive approach would involve, for each element, iterating through the entire array (except for that element) to calculate the product. This results in a nested loop structure, giving a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array.
