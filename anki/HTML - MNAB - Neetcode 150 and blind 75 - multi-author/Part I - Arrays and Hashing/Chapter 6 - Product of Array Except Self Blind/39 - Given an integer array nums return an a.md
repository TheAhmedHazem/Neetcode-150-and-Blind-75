==================== Question ====================  

### Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `output` where `output[i]` is the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

Each product is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

Follow-up: Could you solve it in `O(n)` time without using the division operation?

**Example 1:**

<!-- codeblock-start -->
<pre><code>Input: nums = [1,2,4,6]
Output: [48,24,12,8]
</code></pre>
<!-- codeblock-end -->

**Example 2:**

<!-- codeblock-start -->
<pre><code>Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,3]
Output: [0,-6,0,0,0]
</code></pre>
<!-- codeblock-end -->

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`

- `-20 <= nums[i] <= 20`

What is a potential optimization for handling arrays with zeros?

A) Ignore zeros in the calculation

B) Use a different algorithm for arrays with zeros

C) Count the number of zeros and handle cases separately

D) Multiply all elements by a small number to avoid zeros  

==================== Answer ====================  

**Answer**: C

A potential optimization for handling arrays with zeros is to count the number of zeros and handle cases separately. If there's more than one zero, the output will be all zeros except for the zero elements. If there's exactly one zero, only the corresponding zero element in the output will be non-zero (it will be the product of all other elements). This can potentially simplify calculations for arrays containing zeros.
