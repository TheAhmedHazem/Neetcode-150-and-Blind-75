==================== Question ====================  

### You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

_Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it._

**Example 1:**

<!-- codeblock-start -->
<pre><code>Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1-&#x26;gt;4-&#x26;gt;5,
  1-&#x26;gt;3-&#x26;gt;4,
  2-&#x26;gt;6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1-&#x26;gt;1-&#x26;gt;2-&#x26;gt;3-&#x26;gt;4-&#x26;gt;4-&#x26;gt;5-&#x26;gt;6
</code></pre>
<!-- codeblock-end -->

**Example 2:**

<!-- codeblock-start -->
<pre><code>Input: lists = []
Output: []
</code></pre>
<!-- codeblock-end -->

**Example 3:**

<!-- codeblock-start -->
<pre><code>Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
</code></pre>
<!-- codeblock-end -->

**Constraints:**

- `k == lists.length`

- `0 <= k <= 10^4`

- `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`

- `10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`

- `lists[i]` is sorted in **ascending order**.

- The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

With the recursive approach in mind, how would we invert a binary tree?

A) Swap the left and right children of the root node, then recursively invert the left and right subtrees

B) Recursively invert the left subtree, then the right subtree, then swap the left and right children of the root node

C) Recursively invert the right subtree, then the left subtree, then swap the left and right children of the root node

D) Any of the above.  

==================== Answer ====================  

**Answer**: D

The recursive approach to inverting a binary tree would involve swapping the left and right children of the root node, as well as recursively inverting the left subtree, and the right subtree. But it doesn’t matter the order we execute these operations because none of them interfere with each other.
