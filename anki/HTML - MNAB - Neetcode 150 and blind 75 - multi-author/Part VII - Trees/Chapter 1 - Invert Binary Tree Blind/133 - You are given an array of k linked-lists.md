==================== Question ====================  

### You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

_Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it._

**Example 1:**

<!-- codeblock-start -->
<pre><code>Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1-&#x26;gt;4-&#x26;gt;5,
  1-&#x26;gt;3-&#x26;gt;4,
  2-&#x26;gt;6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1-&#x26;gt;1-&#x26;gt;2-&#x26;gt;3-&#x26;gt;4-&#x26;gt;4-&#x26;gt;5-&#x26;gt;6
</code></pre>
<!-- codeblock-end -->

**Example 2:**

<!-- codeblock-start -->
<pre><code>Input: lists = []
Output: []
</code></pre>
<!-- codeblock-end -->

**Example 3:**

<!-- codeblock-start -->
<pre><code>Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
</code></pre>
<!-- codeblock-end -->

**Constraints:**

- `k == lists.length`

- `0 <= k <= 10^4`

- `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`

- `10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`

- `lists[i]` is sorted in **ascending order**.

- The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

Which tree traversal can be used to solve this problem?

A) Depth-First Search (DFS)

B) Breadth-First Search (BFS)

C) Neither DFS nor BFS

D) Both DFS and BFS  

==================== Answer ====================  

**Answer**: D

Both Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) could be used to solve this problem. Both methods would work because the order in which we visit the nodes doesn't matter in this problem, as long as every node’s children are swapped.
